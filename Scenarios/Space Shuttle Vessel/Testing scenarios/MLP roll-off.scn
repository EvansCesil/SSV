After a successful launch, MLP-2 needs to be rolled off 39A and back into the VAB. The CT is parked just outside the pad gate and ready to head up the pad ramp to retrieve the MLP. Use the Laser Docking System (LDS) display for proper alignment with the MLP. Once in the proper alignment with the MLP, press Ctrl-J to jack up the CT to pick up height (3.00 on the AVERAGE HEIGHT gage). Once the CT has reached the pick up height press J to attach the MLP to the CT. Once the MLP has been attached to the CT press Ctrl-J to jack up the CT to clearance height (6.00 on the AVERAGE HEIGHT gage). Once clearance height has been reached you can begin the trek back to the VAB.

Once clear of the MLP mounts at the pad press Ctrl-K twice to jack the CT/MLP down to the standard travel height (1.34 on the AVERAGE HEIGHT gage).
